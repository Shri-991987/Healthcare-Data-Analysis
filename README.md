###Overview of Patient Waitlist Trends

Total Patient Waitlist: 709K (Current) vs. 640K (Previous Year) → 10.8% increase

Main Drivers of Increase: High outpatient demand and backlog in key specialties.

Critical Issue: Growing wait times, especially in long-term (18+ months) cases.

###Case Type Distribution

Outpatient: 72.49% (majority of cases)
Day Case: 16.89%
Inpatient: 10.62%

Key Insight: Outpatient cases dominate the healthcare system, highlighting the need for better scheduling and resource allocation.

###Waitlist Analysis by Specialty and Age Profile

Top Specialties by Patient Volume


Implication: These specialties face high demand and potential resource bottlenecks.

####Waitlist by Age Profile

0-3 Months: Majority of cases, indicating fast service for some patients.
18+ Months: Large backlog, particularly in high-demand specialties (e.g., Cardiology, Orthopaedics).

Recommendation: Prioritization of long-waiting patients through targeted interventions.

####Monthly Trends and Growth Patterns

Outpatient Cases: Increased from 501K (July 2018) to 629K (Jan 2021).
Day Cases: Peaked at 62K in mid-2020.
Inpatient Cases: Stable (~20K-25K range).

Key Observation: Sustained growth in outpatient demand, requiring improved patient flow management.

###Specialty Group Categorization and Key Bottlenecks

Recommendation: Focused capacity expansion in critical specialties to reduce wait times.

###Insights and Recommendations

###Key Issues Identified

✅ High outpatient demand leading to long wait times.
✅ Specific specialties (Bones, Heart, ENT) experiencing bottlenecks.
✅ Paediatric specialties facing increasing patient volumes.
✅ Growing backlog in 18+ months category.

###Proposed Solutions

Optimizing Appointment Scheduling – Prioritize long-waiting patients in critical specialties.
Resource Reallocation – Increase staffing in Orthopaedics, Cardiology, and ENT.
Telemedicine Expansion – Reduce outpatient pressure by enabling virtual consultations.
Data-Driven Decision Making – Use Power BI insights for real-time monitoring and response planning.

###Conclusion

The current patient waitlist trends indicate a pressing need for better resource allocation and strategic intervention in high-demand specialties. Implementing efficient scheduling, capacity expansion, and digital transformation will be crucial in addressing patient backlog and improving service delivery.
